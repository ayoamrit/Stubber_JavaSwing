# Stubber_JavaSwing
A GUI-based application built in Java with Swing, GUI-tookit which has a wide variety of widgets for building optimized window-based applications that generate pay stubs. The application allows users to generate pay stubs as quickly as possible and has the ability to fill in employee's details automatically, only if saved. iText, a Java library which allows you to create, read and manipulate PDF, is used to create pay stubs in PDF format.
Moreover, I used multithreading allowing program to utilize CPU more efficiently through multitasking.



- Company and employee data is saved to different text files.

- Data is read on a different thread, at the beginning of the program, to make the programs' functionality fast.

- Pay stubs are saved in a PDF format. <br/>
